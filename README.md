# Brackets Color Scheme

This package for Sublime Text provides two color schemes (light and dark) similar to the [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) text editor.

## Installation

An installation via [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) is recommended. The color scheme is listed as `Brackets Color Scheme` in the packages list.

Alternatively you can perform a manual installation:

1. Open the packages directory of Sublime Text, e.g. by using `Preferences > Browse Packages...` within Sublime Text.
2. [Download](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-color-scheme/archive/master.zip) and unzip the files from this repository or clone it using the command

        git clone https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-color-scheme.git "Brackets Color Scheme"
